== Compatibility ==

Tested on Spigot-1.8.8

== Introduction ==

This is fully customizable plugin that allows You to make your own explosives.
Existing blocks physics will be not changed.

==== You can configure: ====
* Existing and new you own Recipes
* Delay before action, explosion radius, etc.
* Explosive base material (sponge by default)
* Action scenario (explosion, potion effect applier, static repeater, seismic push)
* All other valuable parameters.

==== Default set of explosives: ====

{{http://dev.bukkit.org/media/images/73/939/Bomb.png|Bomb}}
{{http://dev.bukkit.org/media/images/74/96/Flash_Bomb.png|Flash Bomb}}
{{http://dev.bukkit.org/media/images/73/940/Nuclear_Bomb.png|Nuclear Bomb}}

==== Custom Nuke may be activated by several conditions: ====

* Red stone right above this block:

{{http://dev.bukkit.org/media/images/73/937/Activate.png|Activate Custom Nuke by Red stone}}

* With "flint and steel"

* By other explosion, if this block will be destroyed.

The main idea to activate explosives is: make red stone schemas
or a chain of "Toy Bomb" right to main explosive (like "Nuclear Bomb")

== Features ==
* You can assign infinite number of different actions to one explosive.

By example, your "Bomb" can explode twice with small interval between
two explosions and glass-blocks will not protect enemy from this type of explosive.

* You can add several potion effects with different strength.
In depending of radius between epicenter and target.

* You can add "static" repeaters to run some scenario every seconds.
By example, add "radiation effect": area with radius 200 where every 2 seconds
all living entities will take potion effect "poison".

* All special blocks and repeaters will be saved after server reload

* Additionally there are good help in configuration file (config.yml)
and error messages with explanation what exactly is wrong in your config (in console logs).

== Commands ==

* customnukes reload - reload config from disk
* customnukes give <player> <explosive-key> <amount>
* customnukes clear - remove all explosive blocks and active repeaters

== Permissions ==

* Access to 'reload' command:

customnukes.reload (default: op)

* Access to 'give' command:

customnukes.give (default: op)

* Access to place, break, craft items of specific explosive type: 

customnukes.explosive.<explosive-key> (default: op)

This works only if 'check-permissions' is set to 'true' in config.yml.

* Access to 'clear' command:

customnukes.clear (default: op)

== TODO ==
* Integration with WorldGuard
* A new explosion type that replaces a set of blocks in sphere to another set with defined probability
* An ability to throw explosives
