== Introduction ==

This is fully customizable plugin that allows You to make your own explosives.
Existing blocks physics will be not changed.

==== You can configure: ====
* Existing and new you own Recipes
* Delay before action, explosion radius, etc.
* Explosive base material (sponge by default)
* Action scenario (explosion, potion effect applier, static repeater, seismic push)
* All other valuable parameters.

==== Custom Nuke may be activated by several conditions: ====

* Red stone right above this block:
* With "flint and steel"
* By other explosion, if this block will be destroyed.

The main idea to activate explosives is: make red stone schemas
or a chain of "Toy Bomb" right to main explosive (like "Nuclear Bomb")

== Features ==
* You can assign infinite number of different actions to one explosive.

By example, your "Bomb" can explode twice with small interval between
two explosions and glass-blocks will not protect enemy from this type of explosive.

* You can add several potion effects with different strength.
In depending of radius between epicenter and target.

* You can add "static" repeaters to run some scenario every seconds.
By example, add "radiation effect": area with radius 200 where every 2 seconds
all living entities will take potion effect "poison".

* All special blocks and repeaters will be saved after server reload

* Additionally there are good help in configuration file (config.yml)
and error messages with explanation what exactly is wrong in your config (in console logs).
